#### Nikolay's Practice page
Some time ago I took Nikolay Advolodkin's [Excellent Course](https://courses.ultimateqa.com/courses/selenium-with-c) On building a framework within Selenium/C#.  This repository contains sample code for automated testing of his [Ultimate QA Practice Page](https://www.ultimateqa.com/automation/)

### Dave Haeffner's practice site (taking it up a notch)
I'm just starting to write automation for [this site](Dave Haeffner) this site, which has some new challenges:

# Data Projects (Python)

## D4D Project
Awhile back I did a project for [Data for Democracy](https://www.datafordemocracy.org/)  trying to sort through VA datasets.  It was a great first attempt at data munging and I really enjoyed the project.  Currently the project is dormant - but I may use some of these tools for other projects in the future.  The repo is [here](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/VA-open-data) but 
[This notebook](https://github.com/dkotschessa/VA-open-data/blob/master/VA-Data_Tools.ipynb) explains what I was doing.


Watch this space! I'm currently doing some basic data analysis on local (Tampa) data and when I have something to say about it, I'll do so here.
